# Prime-Verifier
A simple CLI prime verifier

# How to use
The program is run first by downloading the code. The code must be compiled before used and any conventional C compiler should be able to compile it. For `GCC`, change into the directory of the `main.c` file and run `gcc main.c -o prime-verifier.exe`. Make sure a version of GCC is installed and added to the CLI command path before comilation. Lastly, run the program by typing `./prime-verifier.exe <number>` where you substitute `<number>` with the number you want to test.
